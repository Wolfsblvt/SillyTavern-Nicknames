# SillyTavern Nicknames

*An Extension allowing you to set nicknames for both characters and personas. The nicknames will be used in prompts towards the model.*

## Concept

This allows for longer and more detailed names to be displayed in the chat menu, character list and other places, but let's the model work with the actual name you want to be used in messages.

## Features

- Overrides `{{char}}` and `{{user}}` macros used in **all** of the prompts
- This will also replace the names used when "Always add character's name to prompt" is selected
